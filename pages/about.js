                  I see myself as stuck somewhere between the literary and tech worlds. Aside from being a dev, I'm currently revising my 
                  first novel manuscript, plus I have a couple of other writing projects going on (but I'm trying to get into the habit of 
                  finishing things before I start new ones). Otherwise, you'll most likely find me stuck in a good book. I veer strongly 
                  towards novels and memoirs with queer or feminist themes.

                  Blogging has been part of my life since circa 2005. I made the original iteration of this one (what happened to it?)
                  in 2019, initially to document my journey as a developer, and to practise making a real, live website with a database and
                  everything. Building a blog, rather than relying one of the popular hosting sites, was the perfect way to achieve both those things.
              </p>
                  <br></br>
              <p>
                  At the same time, as I was starting out on the new terrain of tech, it quickly became obvious that quite apart from actually learning to 
                  code and use common developer tools, it was going to be an uphill struggle. For one thing, my gender was underrepresented in this new 
                  industry, and what's more, at that point I had around five years of a different career under my belt ‚Äî¬†a so-called "non-technical" career,
                  at that.

                  Actually, I never doubted that my experience as a natural-language professional was a strength, but some overlooked or dismissed this. This inspired
                  me to make my blog not just a <a href="https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/">learning in public</a> resource, actively have a mission behind it: 
                  to show that two of my passions, literature and programming, might not be so different after all. I firmly believe that we don't need to whittle ourselves 
                  down into one category, no matter how disparate those categories might appear at first glance.
              </p>

              <p>
                  I chose to study foreign languages at university, initially because of my desire to access other cultures, but in retrospect,
                  it was also because of my love of syntax, structure, and making tiny changes to a bigger picture. I found that various elements, possibly abstract or
                  random at first glance, could slot neatly into place and effect powerful messages.
              </p>

                  We all contain multitudes. Now I build software for a living, but in no way does that mean I'm exclusively a developer. I haven't given up on writing, nor do I no longer identify
                  as a writer. In fact, I believe my continuing writing practice keeps me in balance.
