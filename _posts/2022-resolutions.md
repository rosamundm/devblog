<p data-block-key="26qxe">I haven&#x27;t set formal resolutions for a few years, it seems; it was always too stressful. Right now, a lot of people are like &quot;my goal is just to survive&quot;, and that&#x27;s <a href="https://twitter.com/sarahclazarus/status/1471297392041463810">completely</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/drdevonprice/status/1476692489138577414">valid</a>. However, I want to set myself three goals with concrete benchmarks (well, these are just the public ones, hehe):</p>

## ðŸ’« Get promoted

I would like to drop the &quot;junior&quot; from my title. I recently started at a company where I feel well-supported in my professional development path, so I&#x27;m pretty optimistic about this one.</p>

## ðŸ’« Submit my novel manuscript

In 2021, I didn&#x27;t get as far with my publishing journey as I&#x27;d hoped. Yes, I did finally <a href="https://rosederwelt.com/how-i-scrummed-my-novel/">complete my first draft</a> in February, which I&#x27;m still proud of myself about. But my first reader didn&#x27;t finish looking at the draft until June, and then life got hectic. So, the current status is I&#x27;m still incorporating that feedback and also just tweaking bits that I spot as I go through it. I don&#x27;t really know how long that will take, but I do know I don&#x27;t want to wait yet another year until a third party has seen it.

## ðŸ’« Reach B1-level Russian

Right now I am probably at the lower end of A2, and I&#x27;d like to get reasonably confident in speaking/listening. If all goes well, I will be visiting Ukraine sometime this year and it would be awesome to get the most out of that experience by having a decent command of the language. (Yes, people speak Russian in Ukraine... no, it doesn&#x27;t mean they support Putin.)
