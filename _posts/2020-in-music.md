It's been a few years since I've made "albums of the year" lists in earnest; I think it's because I felt exhausted trying to keep up with new releases and when I did, ranking them felt pointless. In fact, Bandcamp is now deviating from traditional rankings — read why [here](https://daily.bandcamp.com/best-of-2020/farewell-to-ranked-lists).

This year has been... different, and I've actually found myself in a headspace to sink into albums a bit more (silver linings?). There were some established artists whom I finally clicked with for the first time; that's always nice after a musical drought. Here are a few 2020 releases that have summed up the year for me, in alphabetical order. They'll always remind me of chilly days walking through deserted streets and sweltering nights spent holed up coding & writing.
